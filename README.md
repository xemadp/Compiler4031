# Lexer
The lexical analyzer generator `flex` is used to tokenize the input streams into tokens in the project specification format.
A symbol table is contained within the implementation of this lexer, to help with error handling in the future.

## Test Cases
Some Programs written using the program specification, to use for Lexer.
they have been written to test the lexer against and can be found in the `lexer/TestCases` directory.

# TODO

- [x] Write Lexical Analyzer Generator in lex/flex.
- [x] Add Manual Lexer Output for the Lexer to be checked against.
- [x] Add Symbol Table Functionality using hashtable implementation.
- [x] Integrate Symbol Table into lexer.
- [ ] Add proper pattern rules to flex program.
- [ ] Add github pages for testcase check automataion.
