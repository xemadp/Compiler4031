# Lexer
The lexer will be made according to the grammar and lexemes/token_names provided in
phase1.pdf.

We will use flex in order to generate the Lexical Analyzer. The symbol table will be
directly integrated into the lex.l file.

# Makefile
Makefile can be used to easily compile and create the lexer.
