# Created a Double Hashing probing hash table based symbol table.
This Method is great for a standard compiler that is meant to be used by users.
Although for the purposes of this project, I will transition to a more basic linear probing hash table model for the symbol table.

# Change the symbol table into a more simple one, by using linear probing.
The new symbol table, puts the symbols in the linear probing fashion. As a matter of fact, it is done linearly for the current purposes of this project.
the hashing really doesn't add meaningfull info to the lexer output, however error handling is much more constructive.
